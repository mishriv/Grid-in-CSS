Task 5:
Problem Statement
Explain the difference between justify-items and justify-self using code examples.

1- Justify-items: is a property that you apply to the container (the parent element), and it defines the default horizontal alignment for all the items within that container.

Example:

.container {
  display: grid;
  justify-items: center;
} 
In this example, all items within the .container will be horizontally centered because of the justify-items: center property on the container.


2- Justify-self: is a property that you apply to individual items (child elements) within a container, allowing you to override the default alignment set by justify-items for that specific item.

Example:

.container {
  display: grid;
  justify-items: center;
}

.item {
  justify-self: start
}
In this example, even though the container is set to justify-items: center, the .item has its alignment set to start, so it will be left-aligned within the container.
